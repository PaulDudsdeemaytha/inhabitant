## What I learned

This was a project I made during my time at a coding bootcamp called RED Academy. Not including the initial WordPress setup, I was given roughly a week to style and add functionality to Inhabitant. It was a daunting task at first, but doable for sure. 

The main takeaway I got from this project is to always take time to layout how I am going to approach styling every page. On the first day, I made the mistake of jumping right into coding, and realized that I could of been much more efficient with my code if I spent time organizing my thoughts first. I decided to take few steps back and restart some of my initial progress, which ended up saving me a lot of time later in the project. 

After this project, I understand that being able to approach problems effectively is one of the best skills a programmer can have.
