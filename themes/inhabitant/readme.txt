#INHABITENT

In this project, we used WP and created our own custom theme for a hipster camping supply company called Inhabitent. The website include home page
where we used WP functions to feature the most recent posted articles. There is also a journal page that includes a chronilogical order of articles 
and a shop page for all the items availble for purchase. 

#Tools used

This project involved alot of PHP and CSS, however other tools we used to create this website was GULP, JS, jQuery. 

#Outcomes

When looking back at thsi Project, I realize how much time must be put into creating a custom WP theme. However, Wordpress is such a powerful tool 
that it allows endless possibilities. I've learned that almost any design ideas I have for web developemnt can all be possible through the power of Wordpress.
So although the process of WP can be time-consuming, this CMS is so powerful it's worth it.
